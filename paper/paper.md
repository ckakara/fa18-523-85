## ABSTRACT   

Nowadays, online shopping has become a more popular way in consuming. Traditional retailers are eager to find a way to maintain the revenue, the online retailers are also finding ways to extend the market. The rise of ‘big data’ had impacted on marketing research and practice a lot. As technology developed, we have huge data of consumer behaviors which could be very detailed and accurate, but how to mine the data is a problem. In this article, we talk about the application of big data in the consumer behaviors data, subsequently discuss how the TensorFlow can translate the data into valuable conclusions in consumers’ behaviors research.

### KEYWORDS   

Consumer Behaviors, Python, TensorFlow, big data, deep learning

## INTRODUCTION   


The availability of data at large volume, variety, velocity and veracity, often termed as ‘Big Data’, had a big impact on marketing research and practice. The wealth of personal information available about consumers online makes it possible to understand and cater to the individual needs of consumers better than ever before. Whether it is their Spotify playlists, Facebook profile, Google search queries, or mobile location, the digital footprints consumers leave with every step they take in the digital environment create extensive records of their personal habits and preferences [1]. By tapping into this rich pool of consumer data, businesses can enhance consumers’ experience by better matching the marketing offering to consumers’ preferences and do so at the appropriate moment.

## TECHNOLOGY BECKGROUND   


TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit.   


TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.   


TensorFlow provides stable Python API and C APIs as well as without API backwards compatibility guarantee like C++, Go, Java, JavaScript and Swift.   


##  BIG DATA APPLICATIONS TO UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIORS   


Research that mine the behaviors data in multiple ways.

## USING CASE   


Cases that using tensorflow to deal with the consumer behavior data and provide useful insight.

## CHALLENGES   


Some challenges in mining behaviors data, such as how to clean the data, how to define the features, how to choose algorithm.

## CONCLUSION
