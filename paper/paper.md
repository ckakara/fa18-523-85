## Abstract

Nowadays, online shopping has become a more popular way in consuming. Traditional retailers are eager to find a way to maintain the revenue, the online retailers are also finding ways to extend the market. The rise of 'big data' had impacted on marketing research and practice a lot. As technology developed, we have huge data of consumer behaviors which could be very detailed and accurate, but how to mine the data is a problem. In this article, we talk about the application of big data in the consumer behaviors data, subsequently discuss how the TensorFlow can translate the data into valuable conclusions in consumers’ behaviors research.


## Introduction


As we know, Big Data always comes with 3V: volume, velocity and veracity. Internet allows us to do almost all work online and keep records of our actions. If you listen a song in the playlist, maybe iTunes will record it as part of your individual activity log, which could be the dataset that explore your interest. If you often use Uber to commute between your home and your company, maybe they could picture your daily life including the places that you have spent time in. If you use your device to safari on the internet, your action of clicking on several links could also be recorded and researched since the action contains you using habits and preferences [1]. The online shopping data includes consumer’s all kinds of information: age, job, education, catalog preferences, price sensitivity, etc. But some of them are not presented to us directly, mining the consumer behaviors is an appropriate way to get access to the hidden information. How could we mine something meaningful to explore consumer behaviors and provide valuable insight? The answer lies on several using cases and the understanding of market research and also the human psychology research.


## Technology Background


TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs [2]. Tensor is a term in math and the flow indicate the action that TensorFlow will help you to finish. You can deploy computation to CPU or GPU, as we know, in blockchain, GPU works better than CPU since the fundamental design of GPU fits better in the computation of blockchain. TesorBoard, a data visualization toolkit, is also included in TensorFlow.   

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well [2]. To support more developers, Python API and C APIs are also available in TensorFlow.



##  Big Data Applications to Understanding Behaviors


Research that mine the behaviors data in multiple ways.

The behaviors have many kinds of manifestation, some of them are digital and some are not. The customers may act across in multiple pages or interaction interface, which could contain useful information to picture the customer. There is a way to implement the analytics called, the “four rights”, talk to the right audience, through the right channel, with the right message, ate the right time [3].

Understanding customer behavior can help your organization in more ways than you think. The entire customer lifecycle can be optimized using behavior analytics:

* Customer acquisition: Marketing will target high-value customer segments identified by behavior analytics and study behavior patterns to determine the best potential offers.
* Customer engagement: Behavior patterns will be used to generate personalized next-best, cross-sell and up-sell offers, while behavioral customer segmentation will be used for more general customer marketing offers.
* Customer retention: Behavior patterns will be used to detect possible customer churn and generate next-best retention offers [3].


## Using case


Cases that using tensorflow to deal with the consumer behavior data and provide useful insight.

## Challenges


Some challenges in mining behaviors data, such as how to clean the data, how to define the features, how to choose algorithm.
